=======

Installation
------------

``` r
devtools::install_github("jonocarroll/mathpix")
```

Authentication
--------------

Obtain a Mathpix API key by e-mailing <support@mathpix.com> then set the following values in your `~/.Renviron` file

``` r
MATHPIX_APP_ID=yourID
MATHPIX_APP_KEY=yourKEY
```

I have included a general API key with this package, but misuse of it will result in it being cancelled. There is also a trial API key which can be invoked using the `trial = TRUE` argument to some functions.

Usage
-----

If you have an image you would rather properly encode in LaTeX, for example

![](./inst/integral.jpg)

then simply calling

``` r
mathpix("./integral.jpg")
```

(with the appropriate path to the file) will insert a LaTeX block into your document which will render what the image represents

    $$
     \int \frac { 4 x } { \sqrt { x ^ { 2 } + 1 } } d x  
    $$

which renders to

![](./inst/eq_no_01.png)

Even complicated, hand-drawn figures work

![](./inst/matrix_3x3.jpg)

``` r
mathpix("./inst/matrix_3x3.jpg")
```

    $$
     A = \left( \begin{array} { l l l } { 2 } & { 7 } & { 3 } \\ { 3 } & { 5 } & { 2 } \\ { 9 } & { 4 } & { 1 } \\ \end{array} \right)  
    $$

![](./inst/eq_no_02.png)

If you also wish to generate the images (although `rmarkdown` will gladly do this for you) this can be achieved using

``` r
render_latex(latex, fileDir)
```

where `latex` is the LaTeX generated by `mathpix()` (or any other escaped LaTeX) and `fileDir` is the (optional) directory where you wish to save the image (by default, a temp file). This requires that you have `pdflatex` set up correctly and available on your machine.
